Libre is a social network software trying to respect users privacy

Features
========

* a user can post messages to his/her friends or to public
* a user can see two feeds of messages:
    * a friends feed showing private messages from his/her friends
    * a public feed showing public messages from his/her friends and the users he/she follows
* every message can be liked, commented and reposted (to either feed).
* every message expires after 3 days of inactivity (any likes or comments reset the expiration)


Privacy policy
==============

Users privacy is the primary concern. This means that Libre doesn't store any data that are not
strictly necessary to make it work. You cannot be forced to provide data you don't have to a third party.

How do we protect your privacy:

* everything you post expires after a few days, giving you the right to sink into oblivion
* if you sign up with Facebook, Google or Twitter, we only store a hash of your ID. This means
we can't access to your social account nor find your social account from the data we store.
* no resources are loaded from third party servers, preventing you from being tracked.
This includes no ads nor 3rd party analitycs service.
